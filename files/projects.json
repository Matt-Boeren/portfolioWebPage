With building and programming the penplotter I wanted to show what I was capable of doing at that moment.</p><p>When I finished my integrated project I could connect my computer to the machine and give in a command to draw a basic shape. The shapes my machine could draw were lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, and circle arcs.</p><h3>Read my integrated project</h3><p>To read my integrated project click <a href=\"Integrated_project_penplotter.pdf\">here</a> (in Dutch).</p><h2>Research assignment</h2><p>In my first year of college I had to make a research assignment. I chose to make a drawing application for my penplotter. With the drawing application, the user is able to make a drawing with the basic shapes on a computer before drawing it permanently on something. I programmed the application in the Java environment Processing because a Processing application can easily communicate with an Arduino. An Arduino is the microcontroller I used to build the penplotter.</p><h3>Read my research assignment</h3><p>To read my research assignment click <a href=\"Research_assignment_penplotter.pdf\">here</a>.</p>"

I programmed mine to play the classic game of snake on it.</p><p>I built it in my free time just for fun and to learn. In this project, I learned to work with shift registers. With a shift register, you can control more digital outputs using only three digital outputs of a microcontroller. In this case, the microcontroller used was an Arduino Nano.</p>"

He wanted to know it because he had a problem with storing bridges made out of spaghetti over a longer period of time.</p><p>So I built a contraption with an Arduino, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, a real-time clock, and an SD card module. Every five minutes it makes a measurement, and the measurement is stored on the SD card. After measuring, the data can be plotted in a graph.</p>"
